# Full Stack Open Project
My journey through the University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open Course.
This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications implemented with ReactJS and supporting them with RESTful web services implemented with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.
